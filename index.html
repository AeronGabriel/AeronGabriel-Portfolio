                     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                      electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                      the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including

                        <p>As part of our requirement, we developed a web-based system for Barangay Bayan Luma I in Imus, Cavite.
                            It is an online data storage for all the reports such as incidents, violations, and blotters. We decided 
                            to develop this web-based system because we noticed that most of the barangays in the Philippines record
                            their data through a log book which isn't an efficient way to store reports and it could be time consuming
                            to find the old records. Our system is also capable of generating a barangay clearance if the person requesting
                            has a clean record in their barangay.

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                      electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                      the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                      versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
