                        my supervisor taught me some formulas to sort data and find duplicates and discrepancies. Though my internship isn't 
                        really aligned with what I've studied, I did learn new things as a data encoder/analysis.

                    <h3>A Web-Based Violation and Incident Report System for Barangay bayan Luma I, Imus, Cavite</h3>
                    <h4>PHP | JavaScript | HTML | CSS</h4>
                    <p>As part of our requirement, we developed a web-based system for Barangay Bayan Luma I in Imus, Cavite.
                        It is an online data storage for all the reports such as incidents, violations, and blotters. We decided 
                        to develop this web-based system because we noticed that most of the barangays in the Philippines record
                        their data through a log book which isn't an efficient way to store reports and it could be time consuming
                        to find the old records. Our system is also capable of generating a barangay clearance if the person requesting
                        has a clean record in their barangay.
